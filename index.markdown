## Introduction
I am:
- a software engineer and a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) enthusiast
- an empathetic person and a fast learner
- experienced in back-end development and familiar with data science
- passionate about [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) and [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
