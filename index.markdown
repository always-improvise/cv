## Introduction
I'm an empathetic person, a software engineer and a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) enthusiast.<br>
I love software development with a burning passion, and I'm becoming better at it every day since I started 12 years ago.

I care about:
- My team, our well-being
- Software design, code quality and maintainability
- Following best practices and cultures like [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)

I believe that well organized work processes lead to sustainable future.
